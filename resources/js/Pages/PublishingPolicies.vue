          <AccordionItemComponent heading_id="headingOne" collapse_id="collapseOne" title="Ethical Oversight">
            <p>The policy of the journals, issued by Aperier, concerning the oversight on how the ethical principles are
              observed is built on mutual trust of the publication process participants and hope for compulsory
              observance of all the publication ethics principles, described in the "Publishing policies" and "Editorial
              policies" of the company.</p>
            <p>We focus on the <a href="https://publicationethics.org/" target="_blank">СОРE</a> definition, of Ethical
              oversight, namely &ldquo;Ethical oversight should include,
              but is not limited to, policies on consent to publication, publication on vulnerable populations, ethical
              conduct of research using animals, ethical conduct of research using human subjects, handling confidential
              data and of business/marketing practices&rdquo;. Based on this definition, the editorial staff of the
              journals works under the issue of observing the ethical principles.</p>
            <p>The journals will be bound to consider the appeals from the Ethics and Oversight Committee for
              professional and scientific activity concerning the non-observance of the ethical principles by our
              authors. We are also ready to consider other appeals in case they are not anonymous and substantiated.</p>

          <AccordionItemComponent heading_id="headingTwo" collapse_id="collapseTwo" title="Authorship">
            <p>We consider the author (co-author) of a research article as it is done by <a
                href="https://publicationethics.org/" target="_blank">Committee on Publication Ethics
                (COPE)</a> , that is the person who is the creator or originator of an idea (e.g., the author of the
              theory of
              relativity) or the individual or individuals who develop and bring to fruition the product that
              disseminates intellectual or creative works. The status of the article writer means that this person
              performed the research and did not infringe the copyright and other persons' rights.</p>
            <p>Aperier follows the <a
                href="https://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html"
                target="_blank">International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE)</a> guidelines which state
              that in order to qualify for authorship of a manuscript, authors must meet all four criteria:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work; or the acquisition, analysis, or
                interpretation of data for the work; AND</li>
              <li>Drafting the work or revising it critically for important intellectual content; AND</li>
              <li>Final approval of the version to be published; AND</li>
              <li>Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the
                accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Those who contributed to the work but do not qualify for authorship should be listed in the
              acknowledgments. More detailed guidance on authorship is given by ICMJE.</p>
            <p>Any change to the author list during the editorial process or after publication should be approved by all
              authors, including any who have been removed. We reserve the right to request evidence of authorship, and
              changes to authorship after acceptance will be made at the discretion of Aperier.</p>
            <strong>Changes to Authorship</strong>
            <p>Authors are expected to carefully consider authorship before manuscript submission. Any change to the
              author list should be made during the editorial process, before manuscript acceptance. Authorship changes,
              including any addition, removal, or rearrangement of author names will require the approval of all authors
              including any to be removed. To request any change in authorship, the journal must receive a completed
              <span class="text-primary" @click="downloadAuthorshipForm()">AUTHORSHIP CHANGE FORM</span> that includes
              the signatures of all authors, and provides a reason for the change.
              Any changes to authorship requested after manuscript acceptance will result in a delay in publication. If
              the manuscript has already been published, requests for a change in authorship will be evaluated and
              require the publication of a Correction. We reserve the right to request evidence of authorship, and
              changes to authorship after acceptance will be made at the discretion of Aperier.
            </p>
            <strong>Deceased Authors</strong>
            <p>If a manuscript is submitted with a deceased author included in the authorship, or if an author passes
              away during peer review, the corresponding author, or co-authors, should inform the editorial office. If
              the deceased author was a corresponding author, the authorship group should nominate a co-author for this
              role. The corresponding author should confirm the contribution of the deceased author and any potential
              conflicts of interest. Upon publication, a note will be added under the author list.</p>
            <strong>Author Contributions</strong>
            <p>For complete transparency, the roles describe each author's specific contribution to the scholarly
              output. Not all roles can be used in the article and not all roles can be applied to all authors (that is,
              each author could contribute in several roles). Please refer to <a href="https://credit.niso.org/"
                target="_blank">CRediT</a> taxonomy for an explanation of
              terms.</p>
            <p>When submitting an article, the corresponding author should define the role of each author and specify
              the individuals or institutions, in the Acknowledgement, who have also contributed to the article but are
              not its authors. All submitted manuscripts should include an author contributorship statement that
              specifies the work of each author. For research articles with several authors, a short paragraph
              specifying their individual contributions must be provided.</p>
            <p>The corresponding author should act as a point of contact between the editor and the other authors, keep
              co-authors informed, and involve them in major decisions about the publication.</p>
            <p>The following statements should be used: Conceptualization, X.X. and Y.Y.; methodology, X.X.; software,
              X.X.; validation, X.X., Y.Y. and Z.Z.; formal analysis, X.X.; investigation, X.X.; resources, X.X.; data
              curation, X.X.; writing&mdash;original draft preparation, X.X.; writing&mdash;review and editing, X.X.;
              visualization, X.X.; supervision, X.X.; project administration, X.X.; funding acquisition, Y.Y. All
              authors have read and agreed to the published version of the manuscript.</p>
            <p>We kindly hope that when you send an article to the editors of our journals, all those who have really
              contributed to its preparation will be taken into account and there will be no persons unrelated to its
              scientific content. We also hope that there will be no persons among the article writers who would like to
              claim authorship using authority over the true authors, who financed the results generation or sponsored
              АРС payment, who promised to include the true authors in their future article or made this earlier and
              claim now to compensation. If the results presented in the article were received with the someone's
              financial support, then the authors should disclose funding sources directly by pointing them at the end
              of the article.</p>

          <AccordionItemComponent heading_id="headingFive" collapse_id="collapseFive"
            title="Article Withdrawal & Correction">
            <p>We adhere to the guidelines set forth in the joint statement of the International Publishers Association
              (IPA) and the International Federation of Library Associations (IFLA) on the withdrawal of journal
              articles from the internet. These explicitly state that a publication may only be deleted from a
              publisher&apos;s database if it:&nbsp;</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Violates professional ethical standards, such as by violating the privacy of a study subject.&nbsp;
              </li>
              <li>A legal controversy exists.&nbsp;</li>
              <li>Includes locating erroneous or incorrect information that, if used, poses a significant health risk.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Where feasible, we keep the relevant bibliographical citation for the deleted information (unless subject
              to legal dispute).&nbsp;</p>

            <span><strong>Correction Notices</strong></span>
            <p>&nbsp;Since the version of record cannot be altered to reflect changes, such as new author affiliations
              or new discoveries, all published research is essentially a &quot;snapshot&quot; of a certain point in
              time.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>However, we acknowledge that mistakes might occasionally occur during the stages of research, writing,
              and publication. We can introduce one of the following corrective messages when these problems
              occur.&nbsp;</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Erratum: This term often refers to a manufacturing error that was discovered after publication. If an
                erratum is published, it will be noted in the abstract of the paper&apos;s online version as well as in
                the printed edition of the journal&apos;s subsequent volume or issue.&nbsp;</li>
              <li>Name of author corrections; Aperier is dedicated to inclusion, diversity, and equality. Aperier is
                putting into effect an author name change policy as part of this. For whatever reason (including
                religious conversion, marriage, gender identity change, or divorce), if Aperier gets a request from an
                author seeking to alter their name on a published piece, we will do it right away. While we won&apos;t
                inquire about further information or the cause for the name change, there are situations when we may
                need additional details (such the article reference) in order to perform the change successfully. We
                will try our best to change the name and, if necessary, any pronouns throughout the post.</li>
            </ul>

          <AccordionItemComponent heading_id="headingSix" collapse_id="collapseSix" title="Citation Policies">
            <p>Authors should ensure that where material is taken from other sources (including their own published
              writing), the source is clearly cited and that where appropriate permission is obtained.<br>Authors should
              not engage in excessive self-citation of their own work.<br>Authors should not copy references from other
              publications if they have not read the cited work.<br>Authors should not preferentially cite their own or
              their friends&rsquo;, peers&rsquo;, or institution&rsquo;s publications.<br>Authors should not cite
              advertisements or advertorial material.<br>In accordance with COPE guidelines, we expect that
              &ldquo;original wording taken directly from publications by other researchers should appear in quotation
              marks with the appropriate citations&rdquo;. This condition also applies to an author&rsquo;s own work.
              COPE have produced a discussion document on citation manipulation with recommendations for best practice.
