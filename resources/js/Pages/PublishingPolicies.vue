          <AccordionItemComponent heading_id="headingOne" collapse_id="collapseOne" title="Ethical Oversight">
              <P>The mutual trust between those involved in the publication process and the desire for strict adherence
                  to all the publication ethics principles outlined in the institute's "Publishing policies" and
                  "Editorial policies" is the foundation of the Aperier journals' policy regarding oversight of how the
                  ethical principles are maintained.</P>

              <P>We concentrate on the <a href="https://publicationethics.org/" target="_blank">СОРE</a> definition of ethical supervision, that is, rules on permission to
                  publishing, publication on vulnerable populations, ethical conduct of research involving animals and
                  human subjects, managing sensitive data, and business/marketing practises. Based on this description,
                  the editorial team of the journals is challenged to uphold ethical standards in their work.</P>

              <p>The journals will be required to take into account the Ethics and Oversight Committee's requests for
                  professional and scholarly activities on our researchers' disregard for ethical values. In the event
                  that such appeals are not anonymous and proven, we are also prepared to evaluate them.

          <AccordionItemComponent heading_id="headingTwo" collapse_id="collapseTwo" title="Authorship">
              <p>As defined by the <a href="https://publicationethics.org/" target="_blank">Committee on Publication Ethics
                  (COPE)</a>, we take into account the author (co-author) of a research article to be the individual or individuals who develop and bring to fruition the product that disseminates intellectual or creative works. An example of this would be the author of the theory of relativity. The author&apos;s status indicates that they conducted the study and did not violate anybody else&apos;s copyright.</p>
              <p>Aperier abides by the <a
                  href="https://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html"
                  target="_blank">International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE)</a> rules, which say that writers must satisfy all four requirements in order to be eligible to be listed as authors on a manuscript:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>Significant contributions to the idea or design of the work, the collection, analysis, or interpretation of data for the work.</li>
                  <li>The writing or critical revision of the work for significant intellectual substance.</li>
                  <li>Final approval of the published version.</li>
                  <li>Consent to take responsibility for all parts of the work in order to guarantee that any concerns about the accuracy or integrity of any portion of the work are duly investigated and addressed.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Those who contributed to the work but did not meet the criteria to be an author should be acknowledged. ICMJE provides more thorough authoring instructions. All researchers, including those who have been deleted, should provide their consent before any changes to the author list throughout the editing process or after it has been published. We retain the right to ask for proof of authorship, and Aperier reserves the right to modify authorship after acceptance.</p>
              <br>
              <strong>Changes to Authorship</strong>
              <p>Before submitting an article, writers are expected to carefully evaluate authorship. Before the article is accepted, throughout the editorial process, any changes to the author list should be made. Authorship modifications, such as the addition, deletion, or rearranging of author names, require the consent of all authors, including those who will have their names removed. A properly filled-out <span class="text-primary" @click="downloadAuthorshipForm()">AUTHORSHIP CHANGE FORM</span> with the signatures of all authors and a justification for the change must be submitted to the journal in order to seek any change in authorship. After a paper has been accepted, any requested changes to authorship will cause a delay in publishing. Requests for authorship changes will be assessed if the work has already been published and will call for the publishing of a correction. We retain the right to demand authorship proof.</p>
              <br><strong>Deceased Authors</strong>
              <p>The corresponding author, or co-authors, should notify the editorial office if a manuscript is submitted with a deceased author listed among the authorship, or if an author passes away during peer review. The authorship group should propose a co-author for this position in cases where the deceased author served as a corresponding author. The work of the deceased author&apos;s co-author, as well as any possible conflicts of interest, should be verified by the corresponding author. A notice will be included under the list of authors once it has been published.</p>
              <br><strong>Author Contributions</strong>
              <p>The responsibilities outline each author&apos;s unique contribution to the academic work for total transparency. Not all roles can be utilised in the article, and not all researchers can use all roles (that is, each author could contribute in several roles). If you need a definition of the terms, please see the <a href="https://credit.niso.org/"
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             target="_blank">CRediT</a> taxonomy. When submitting an article, the corresponding author should outline the responsibilities of each author and list the people or organisations that contributed to the piece but are not its writers in the acknowledgements section. An author contributorship statement outlining the contributions of each author should be included with every paper that is submitted. Research publications with many authors must include a brief paragraph outlining each author&apos;s unique contributions and corresponding author.</p>
              <p>After the research conclusion, the following statements should be used (use author initials): Conceptualization, X.X. and Y.Y.; methodology, X.X.; software, X.X.; validation, X.X., Y.Y. and Z.Z.; formal analysis, X.X.; investigation, X.X.; resources, X.X.; data curation, X.X.; writing&mdash;original draft preparation, X.X.; writing&mdash;review and editing, X.X.; visualization, X.X.; supervision, X.X.; project administration, X.X.; funding acquisition, Y.Y. All authors have read and agreed to the published version of the manuscript.</p>
              <p>Only those people will be taken into consideration who have actually contributed to its creation. We hope that none of the article authors will attempt to use their position of authority over the real authors to claim authorship, finance the results generation or sponsor the APC payment, make a promise to include the real authors in a future article, or have already made such a promise and are now seeking payment. The authors should immediately declare funding sources at the conclusion of the publication if the results they discuss were obtained with someone else&apos;s financial assistance.</p>
              <br>
              <strong>Corresponding Author</strong>
              <p>The designated Corresponding Author represents all co-authors and ensures that any concerns regarding the correctness or integrity of any aspect of the work are properly handled and responsible of the following;</p>
              <p>Ensuring that the names and order of all stated authors have been authorized in the paper before submission; handling all correspondence between the Journal and all co-authors, both before and after publication; Making sure disclosures, declarations, and transparency on data statements from all authors are included in the manuscript as necessary; providing transparency on the reuse of material; mentioning any unpublished material (for instance, manuscripts in press) included in the manuscript in a cover letter to the editor.</p>

            title="Article Processing Charge">
              <p>
                  Aperier publishes all its journals in full open access, meaning unlimited use and reuse of articles, in addition to giving credit to the authors. All of our articles are published under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" target="_blank"> Creative Commons (CC
                  BY)</a>. Article processing charge (APC) is paid only after the manuscript had been reviewed and accepted for publication. APC covers the costs of the publishing process, including peer-review administration, copy editing, hosting the files, etc. APC varies for each journal and detailed information can be found on concrete journal's page.
                  Currently, all APCs are covered by the Aperier publishing, so there are no publication charges for authors whose work is accepted for publication in Aperier Journals.

            title="Article Withdrawal & Correction">
            <p>We adhere to the guidelines set forth in the joint statement of the International Publishers Association
              (IPA) and the International Federation of Library Associations (IFLA) on the withdrawal of journal
              articles from the internet. These explicitly state that a publication may only be deleted from a
              publisher&apos;s database if it:&nbsp;</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Violates professional ethical standards, such as by violating the privacy of a study subject.&nbsp;
              </li>
              <li>A legal controversy exists.&nbsp;</li>
              <li>Includes locating erroneous or incorrect information that, if used, poses a significant health risk.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Where feasible, we keep the relevant bibliographical citation for the deleted information (unless subject
              to legal dispute).&nbsp;</p>

            <span><strong>Correction Notices</strong></span>
            <p>&nbsp;Since the version of record cannot be altered to reflect changes, such as new author affiliations
              or new discoveries, all published research is essentially a &quot;snapshot&quot; of a certain point in
              time.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>However, we acknowledge that mistakes might occasionally occur during the stages of research, writing,
              and publication. We can introduce one of the following corrective messages when these problems
              occur.&nbsp;</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Erratum: This term often refers to a manufacturing error that was discovered after publication. If an
                erratum is published, it will be noted in the abstract of the paper&apos;s online version as well as in
                the printed edition of the journal&apos;s subsequent volume or issue.&nbsp;</li>
              <li>Name of author corrections; Aperier is dedicated to inclusion, diversity, and equality. Aperier is
                putting into effect an author name change policy as part of this. For whatever reason (including
                religious conversion, marriage, gender identity change, or divorce), if Aperier gets a request from an
                author seeking to alter their name on a published piece, we will do it right away. While we won&apos;t
                inquire about further information or the cause for the name change, there are situations when we may
                need additional details (such the article reference) in order to perform the change successfully. We
                will try our best to change the name and, if necessary, any pronouns throughout the post.</li>
            </ul>

          <AccordionItemComponent heading_id="headingSix" collapse_id="collapseSix" title="Citation Policies">
            <p>Where using information from another source, even their own previously published writing, authors should be care to properly credit the source and acquire permission when necessary. Authors shouldn't reference their own work too frequently. If authors haven't read the mentioned work, they shouldn't replicate references from other publications. Authors shouldn't favourably credit their own works above those of their friends, classmates, or institutions. Advertorial content and advertising should not be cited by authors. We anticipate that "original terminology obtained directly from publications by other academics should appear in quote marks with the relevant citations," in accordance with COPE recommendations. This stipulation likewise holds true for an author's original work. In a discussion document about citation manipulation, COPE makes suggestions for the best practice.
