                        title="Editorial Independence ">
                        <p>Aperier publishes articles that were started by universities and other organisations and in which the business itself was a pioneer. At the same time, &quot;Editorial policies&quot; apply uniformly and independently to all journals.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Journals&rsquo; management works closely with the publisher based on clear assignment of duties and responsibility following the defined &ldquo;Publishing policies&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>We define &quot;editorial independence&quot; as the complete freedom of editors to choose whether or not to publish a paper, edit it, or have it withdrawn based solely on its scientific merit, without interference from the journal&apos;s founders, publisher, authors, their sponsors, or any other institutions or individuals. Additionally, these organisations or people are unable to influence the publishing dates of publications. Not any commercial interests can be of priority over the policy of creating high-quality reviewed journals and cannot be considered in the journal.</p>
                        <p>The editors and members of the editorial boards cannot be fired or replaced for upholding autonomous editorial policy. The editors of the journals receive the absolute right to publish the editorial paper with the intention of amplifying their voice about the editorial policy of the journal as a whole and outlining the position in each individual instance to the academic circles. The editor&apos;s decision to share their viewpoint on this issue in the media and online cannot be judged by the publisher. The editorial board choices of journals cannot be criticised by the publishing company&apos;s founders or employees anywhere or under any circumstances.</p>
                        <p>Aperier&apos;s founders and staff are not permitted to serve as editors or reviewers for any of the publications that the firm publishes. The Aperier founders are currently unable to submit their works for publication in the journals that the business produces.</p>
                        <p>The editorial boards make every choice on their own, free from any outside pressure or influence and without consulting the publisher or any other parties. The journals operate in accordance with the Journal Publishers Code of Conduct.</p>

                        <p>The Editorial Board consists of international experts in their fields. All members of the Board occupy the positions in educational and research institutions. The roles of the Editorial Board members are the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Provide expertise in definite research field;&nbsp;</li>
                            <li>Judge the submitted manuscripts and involve in the process independent reviewers;&nbsp;</li>
                            <li>Advise on journal policy and scope and participate in the journal development;&nbsp;</li>
                            <li>Propose subject definition and conference choice for special issues. Also, editorial members may be guest Editors of special issue;&nbsp;</li>
                            <li>Promote the journal at conferences, seminars, workshops, and relevant public events;&nbsp;</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Guest editors play a vital role in ensuring the quality of special content publications, such as Special Issues. Guest editors overlook the process, from proposal to publication.The Editorial Board is reviewed every two years, which means exclusion of inactive members and addition of the new ones.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>We appreciate applications from the editorial candidates. To submit an application, please send an e-mail to a Managing Editor of the selected journal and attach a file with your CV (containing the current place of work, occupation, education, the scope of your scientific interest, types of activity, list of publications, list of the journals in which you occupy the positions of an editor or a reviewer, e-mail for contact and a link to personal page at your university).</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><strong>Duties of Editors</strong></p>
                        <p>We strongly recommend that Editors get acquainted with and follow COPE Core practices.</p>
                        <p>The editors of the journal are responsible for deciding which of the articles submitted to the journal will be published. The editor may confer with the members of the Editorial Board in making this decision.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Fair play. The editors evaluate manuscripts without regard to the nature of the authors or the host institution including race, gender, religious belief, ethnic origin, citizenship, or political philosophy of the authors.</li>
                            <li>Confidentiality. The editors, members of the Editorial Boards, and any editorial staff must not disclose any information about a submitted manuscript to anyone except the authors of the paper, reviewers, potential reviewers, and the publisher, for appropriate reasons.</li>
                            <li>Disclosure. Unpublished materials disclosed in a submitted paper should not be used in the own research of the editors or the members of the Editorial Board without the express written consent of the author.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Guidelines for Reviewers</strong>
                        <p>When authors decide to submit their articles to one of our journals, Aperier Publisher is aware of the value of a strong peer review procedure. Every journal through a rigorous process to establish and maintain peer review integrity, and a key component of this is making sure that reviewers have the tools they need to do their jobs as effectively and quickly as possible. The reviewing process varies from journal to journal, but this guide serves as an overview of what&rsquo;s involved when becoming a reviewer with Aperier.</p>
                        <p>The COPE Ethical Guidelines for Peer Reviewers should be read and adhered to by all of our reviewers.</p>
                        <p>Potential reviewers should give verified and correct contact information as well as accurate personal and professional information that fairly represents their expertise.</p>
                        <p>We anticipate the following from our reviewers during the peer review process, when preparing the referee report, and after reviewing:</p>
                        <br>
                        <strong>1. Confidentiality</strong>
                        <p>Without express permission from the Editor, reviewers must not discuss the reviewed article with anybody in order to preserve the integrity of the review process.</p>
                        <p>The reviewers are welcome to enlist the assistance of one or two co-workers in the process, but this should only be done with the Editor&apos;s express consent. Colleague participation should also be included in the Referee Report&apos;s Comments to Editors section along with names and affiliations. Information about the paper should not be copied, distributed, or shared by the reviewers for any reason (including advancement of their own research).</p>
                        <p>Any clarifications required from the author(s) should be written in the Referee Report&apos;s Comments section.</p>
                        <br>
                        <strong>2. Standards of Objectivity</strong>
                        <p>Reviewers should be objective while conducting reviews. All the comments and recommendations should be supported with relevant arguments.</p>
                        <br>
                        <strong>3. Timeliness</strong>
                        <p>A timely response is required in order to accept a peer review invitation. Reviewers should only accept to review if they believe they will be able to complete the assignment within the requested or mutually agreed-upon time period and are qualified to evaluate the given paper. The reviews must be finished by the date specified in the invitation. Reviewers are required to get in touch with the handling editor right away if anything happens that would prevent them from submitting the referee report on time.</p>
                        <br>
                        <strong>4. Competing Interests</strong>
                        <p>It&apos;s crucial to maintain objectivity while taking into account factors like a manuscript&apos;s origin, country, religion or political convictions, gender, and/or other characteristics of the writers. We respectfully request that reviewers disclose any potential conflicts of interest that could skew their judgement of the submitted paper (including any financial interest in the publication or non-publication of the manuscript; a recent or ongoing collaboration with the authors; a history of dispute with the authors). The request to evaluate the paper should be declined if the reviewer is now working at the same institution as any of the authors or has recently (i.e., within the last three years) been a mentor, mentee, close collaborator, or joint grant holder.</p>
                        <p>Reviewers shouldn&apos;t agree to read a manuscript for the sole purpose of reading it without actually intending to produce a referee report.</p>
                        <p>Because they had already reviewed a draught of the work for another publication, the reviewers are not barred from examining the current version. However, this should be included in the section under &quot;Comments to Editors.&quot;</p>

                    <AccordionItemComponent heading_id="headingFour" collapse_id="collapseFour" title="Peer Review">
                        <p>Peer review plays a significant role in the publication of scholarly journals through assessment of validity, quality and originality of submitted manuscripts. There are three types of peer review: &ldquo;open&rdquo;, &ldquo;single blind&rdquo; and &ldquo;double blind&rdquo;.</p>
                        <br>
                        <strong>The Process</strong>
                        <p>A corresponding author submits a manuscript and a Cover letter signed by all authors (the manuscript and the Cover letter are sent via the Manuscript Administration System). Also at this stage, authors can suggest appropriate reviewers for this manuscript and include their names and email addresses in the comments section. At the initial stage a Managing Editor checks the structure, spelling and compliance of manuscript with all submission guidelines, plagiarism, etc. If the manuscript doesn&rsquo;t comply with the abovementioned, then it should be rejected.</p>
                        <p>At the next stage, the manuscript is passed to an Editor, who determines its potential interest for readers, importance and relevance for scientists. Also, an Editor assesses correspondence of the manuscript to journal&apos;s scope, as well as its compliance with the requirements of the journal.</p>
                        <p>Manuscripts that don&rsquo;t match these criteria, as well as scientifically poor manuscripts, should be rejected without further peer reviewing. The editors have the right to reject manuscripts at the pre-review stage; manuscripts rejected by the editors at the pre-review stage are not subject to further consideration, and the author cannot re-submit the article for consideration.</p>
                        <p>If the manuscript complies with the requirements of the journal, then the Editor assigns a Handling Editor, responsible for peer review, who sends the manuscript for double blind peer review to two (usually) or more (if necessary) reviewers. The choice of peer-reviewers is based on their expertise, reputation, specific recommendations and previous experience (e.g. Ph.D. rank and relevant publications).</p>
                        <p>The invited reviewers should accept indispensable terms and conditions in order to exclude conflict of interests, confirm their competence, concerning the scope of the manuscript, and specify definite terms of reviewing. Then they decide to accept or decline the invitation. In case of declining, they can recommend alternative reviewers. In case of accepting they should prepare a Referee Report. All manuscripts are double blind peer-reviewed, which means that reviewers do not possess any information about the authors&rsquo; identities and vice versa. Also, at this stage the author should be informed that the manuscript had been sent for double blind peer review.</p>
                        <p>After reviewing, the Handling Editor examines Referee Reports and, in some cases, can invite an additional reviewer in order to get an extra opinion.</p>
                        <p>The authors are provided with reviewers&rsquo; comments (anonymously). After that the revised manuscript passes the second review by Handling Editor (also manuscripts can be re-sent to reviewers after author(s)&rsquo; revision).</p>
                        <p>At the last stage Handling Editor provides the Editor with the information about the reviewing process and sends recommendations, concerning manuscript&apos;s publication. The final decision is taken by the Editor. The authors are informed about the results of reviewing. They can be provided with Referee Reports without identification of the reviewers, if needed. Authors can also appeal against editorial decision, providing their own arguments and explanations.</p>
                        <p>In case of manuscript acceptance, the publication process starts. If rejected, the manuscript is sent to the author(s).</p>

                        <p>Plagiarism, Data Fabrication and Image Manipulation</p>
                        <p>Plagiarism is not acceptable in Aperier journals. Plagiarism includes copying text, ideas, images, or data from another source, even from your own publications, without giving credit to the original source. Reuse of text that is copied from another source must be between quotation marks and the original source must be cited. If a study&apos;s design or the manuscript&apos;s structure or language has been inspired by previous studies, these studies must be explicitly cited. All Aperier submissions are checked for plagiarism. If plagiarism is detected during the peer review process, the manuscript may be rejected. If plagiarism is detected after publication, an investigation will take place and action taken in accordance with our policies.</p>
                        <p>Image files must not be manipulated or adjusted in any way that could lead to misinterpretation of the information provided by the original image. Irregular manipulation includes 1) introduction, enhancement, moving, or removing features from the original image, 2) grouping of images that should obviously be presented separately (e.g., from different parts of the same gel, or from different gels), or 3) modifying the contrast, brightness or color balance to obscure, eliminate or enhance some information.</p>
                        <p>If irregular image manipulation is identified and confirmed during the peer review process, we may reject the manuscript. If irregular image manipulation is identified and confirmed after publication, we may correct or retract the paper.</p>
                        <p>Data presented must be original and not inappropriately selected, manipulated, enhanced, or fabricated. This includes 1) exclusion of data points to enhance significance of conclusions, 2) fabrication of data, 3) selection of results that support a particular conclusion at the expense of contradictory data, 4) deliberate selection of analysis tools or methods to support a particular conclusion (including p-hacking). We strongly recommend preregistration of methods and analysis.</p>

                        <strong>Conflicts of interest</strong>
                        <p>It is crucial that a scientific journal be meticulous and consistently follow the finest writing and publishing principles and publication ethics (COPE). As a result, every step in the process of reviewing and publishing an article should be as explicit and open as feasible.</p>
                        <p>At various stages of writing, processing, peer review, editing, and publication of the article, the editorial board, journal staff, authors, editors, and reviewers interact constantly. Their relationship is not always easy, and various situations may arise (that is, when a person has conflicting interests or loyalty brought on by his obligations to several people or organizations/universities), when a person cannot give due respect to the actual or potentially conflicting obligations of Financial ties (such direct conflicts of interest are typically simple to spot), ideological, religious, and philosophical disagreements, academic gain, competitiveness, and rivalry can all be the basis for an interest conflict.</p>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Authors</strong>
                        <p>The authors of the paper must either attest to the exclusion of any potential conflicts of interest or exclude any potential data manipulation when submitting the manuscript to the journal. Disclosure of any affiliations, facts, deeds, and influences of third parties that could have an impact on the authors&apos; study is entirely their responsibility.</p>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Reviewers</strong>
                        <p>Reviewers should get familiar with the journal&apos;s peer review procedure and the journal itself prior to reading the submission. They should then determine how to assess the article while adhering to the COPE principles. A Concise Guide for New Editors on Ethical Editing.</p>
                        <p>The reviewer should decline to evaluate the manuscript if there are any situations, facts, or behaviours that might compromise the transparency of the article evaluation. Reviewers must notify managing editors or handling editors of any possible conflicts of interest and speak with them.</p>
                        <p>Without first consulting the journals, reviewers shouldn&apos;t utilise the paper for their own gain or draw outside attention to themselves. The paper copy of the manuscript must be destroyed after the article has been reviewed, and the electronic copy must be deleted from any electronic storage devices.</p>
                        <br><strong>Editorial Board Members, Editors, Journal Staff</strong>
                        <p>Founders are not permitted to publish their work in any Aperier-published journal. The managing editor is not permitted to publish his or her personal work in the publication that he or she oversees. If an editorial board member or editor is also the author of a manuscript that has been submitted to the journal on which they serve, they are not permitted to take part in the peer review process or make decisions involving their own work.</p>
                        <p>Editorial Board members, editors, and the managing editor should only operate in the journal&apos;s best interests, base their choices on the quality and relevance of the work for readers, and maintain the privacy of authors and reviewers (keep manuscripts and related materials and information in strict confidentiality). Before the document is published, editorial board members, editors, and the managing editor shouldn&apos;t discuss or utilise its contents.</p>
                        <p>If editors who make final judgments on manuscripts have a conflict of interest involving the manuscripts under review, they should not make editing and publication decisions. Editorial personnel should refrain from using information learned from dealing with submissions for their own benefit.</p>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Aperier Submission System</strong>
                        <p>Editors, members of the editorial board, and reviewers who are also the authors of the article being considered are expressly prohibited from participating in the peer review process by the Aperier Submission System (manuscript and peer review management system).</p>

                        <p>If there is a conflict of interest prior to the publication of the article, whether it has been attested by an author, a reviewer, Editorial Board members, editors, the Managing Editor or the journal staff, or if there has been a leak of information, a conflict of interests statement should be published in the article. In addition, the editor may request and publish related documents so that the reader has all the necessary information and can decide for himself the possibility of the conflict.</p>

A request that the parties concerned substantiate their assertions may be made as part of the investigation. The Publisher will make the decision on the allegedly unlawful material&apos;s removal. The content won&apos;t be taken down if the complaint doesn&apos;t have enough support. There will be documentation of complaint investigations and judgments. Although we strive to provide publications of the greatest calibre, we acknowledge that errors may occasionally occur.</p>
                        <p>All complaints will be taken seriously (within three working days if by email). If at all feasible, a final decision will be reached in two weeks. A temporary response will be provided within two weeks if this is not feasible. Until the complaint is eventually handled, interim replies will be given. If the complainant is still unhappy, the editor will be notified, and their judgement will be final.</p>
