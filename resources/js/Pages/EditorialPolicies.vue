                            editorial paper with the aim to promote their voice concerning the journal&rsquo;s editorial
                            policy as a whole and defining the opinion in every certain case to the academic circles.
                            The publisher has no right to judge the editor&rsquo;s wish to express their opinion on this
                            matter in mass media and on the Internet. The founders and employees of the publishing

                            vital part of this means ensuring that reviewers have the appropriate resources to carry out
                            their work as efficiently and effectively as possible. The reviewing process varies from
                            journal to journal, but this guide serves as an overview of what&rsquo;s involved when

                            information that is accurate and a fair representation of their expertise, including

                            following:<br><br><strong>1. Confidentiality<br></strong>In order to maintain the integrity
                            of the review process, the reviewers shouldn&apos;t discuss the reviewed manuscript with
                            anyone without specific permission from the Editor.<br>The reviewers are welcome to solicit
                            input from one or two colleagues in performing the review, but this should only be done with
                            explicit permission from the Editor. In addition, colleagues&rsquo; (with names and
                            affiliations) involvement should be mentioned in the Comments to Editors section of the
                            Referee Report.<br>The reviewers shouldn&rsquo;t copy, disseminate, or share information,
                            concerning the manuscript for any purpose (including advancement of their own
                            research).<br>If any clarifications from the author/authors are needed, they should be
                            included into the Comments section of the Referee Report.</p>
                        <p><strong>2. Standards of objectivity</strong><br>Reviewers should be objective while
                            conducting reviews. All the comments and recommendations should be supported with relevant
                            arguments.<br><br><strong>3. Timeliness</strong><br>It is necessary to respond to an
                            invitation to peer review within a reasonable time-frame.<br>If the reviewers feel qualified
                            to assess a particular manuscript, they should agree to review only in case of possibility
                            to return a review within the proposed or mutually agreed time-frame.<br>The reviews should
                            be completed by the deadline indicated in invitation. If any difficulties arise that may
                            prevent from submitting the Referee Report in time, the reviewers are obliged to contact the

                        <p><strong>4. Competing interests</strong><br>It is important to remain unbiased by
                            considerations related to the nationality, religious or political beliefs, gender and/or
                            other characteristics of the authors, origin of a manuscript or by commercial
                            considerations.<br>We kindly ask our reviewers to reveal any potential competing interest
                            that may bias the review of the submitted manuscript (including any financial interest in
                            the publication or non-publication of the manuscript; a recent or ongoing collaboration with
                            the authors; a history of dispute with the authors).<br>If the reviewer is currently
                            employed at the same institution as any of the authors or has been recent (e.g., within the
                            past 3 years) mentors, mentees, close collaborators or joint grant holders, the invitation
                            of the manuscript reviewing should be rejected.<br>The reviewers should not agree to review
                            a manuscript just to gain sight of it with no real intention of submitting a Referee
                            Report.<br>The reviewers are not precluded from reviewing the manuscript because of
                            previously reviewing a version of it for another journal. However, this should be noted in
                            the Comments to Editors section.</p>

                        <p>Peer review plays a significant role in the publication of scholarly journals through
                            assessment of validity, quality and originality of submitted manuscripts. There are three
                            types of peer review: &ldquo;open&rdquo;, &ldquo;single blind&rdquo; and &ldquo;double
                            blind&rdquo;.<br><br>The process<br>A corresponding author submits a manuscript and a Cover
                            letter signed by all authors (the manuscript and the Cover letter are sent via the
                            Manuscript Administration System). Also at this stage, authors can suggest appropriate
                            reviewers for this manuscript and include their names and email addresses in the comments
                            section. At the initial stage a Managing Editor checks the structure, spelling and
                            compliance of manuscript with all submission guidelines, plagiarism, etc. If the manuscript
                            doesn&rsquo;t comply with the abovementioned, then it should be rejected.<br>At the next
                            stage, the manuscript is passed to an Editor, who determines its potential interest for
                            readers, importance and relevance for scientists. Also an Editor assesses correspondence of
                            the manuscript to journal&apos;s scope, as well as its compliance with the requirements of
                            the journal.<br>Manuscripts that don&rsquo;t match these criteria, as well as scientifically
                            poor manuscripts, should be rejected without further peer reviewing. The editors have the
                            right to reject manuscripts at the pre-review stage; manuscripts rejected by the editors at
                            the pre-review stage are not subject to further consideration, and the author cannot
                            re-submit the article for consideration.<br>If the manuscript complies with the requirements
                            of the journal, then the Editor assigns a Handling Editor, responsible for peer review, who
                            sends the manuscript for double blind peer review to two (usually) or more (if necessary)
                            reviewers. The choice of peer-reviewers is based on their expertise, reputation, specific
                            recommendations and previous experience (e.g. Ph.D. rank and relevant publications).<br>The
                            invited reviewers should accept indispensable terms and conditions in order to exclude
                            conflict of interests, confirm their competence, concerning the scope of the manuscript, and
                            specify definite terms of reviewing. Then they decide to accept or decline the invitation.
                            In case of declining they can recommend alternative reviewers. In case of accepting they
                            should prepare a Referee Report. All manuscripts are double blind peer-reviewed, which means
                            that reviewers do not possess any information about the authors&rsquo; identities and vice
                            versa. Also at this stage the author should be informed that the manuscript had been sent
                            for double blind peer review.<br>&nbsp;After reviewing, the Handling Editor examines Referee
                            Reports and in some cases can invite an additional reviewer in order to get an extra
                            opinion.<br>The authors are provided with reviewers&rsquo; comments (anonymously). After
                            that the revised manuscript passes the second review by Handling Editor (also manuscripts
                            can be re-sent to reviewers after author(s)&rsquo; revision).<br>&nbsp;At the last stage
                            Handling Editor provides the Editor with the information about the reviewing process and
                            sends recommendations, concerning manuscript&apos;s publication. The final decision is taken
                            by the Editor.<br>The authors are informed about the results of reviewing. They can be
                            provided with Referee Reports without identification of the reviewers, if needed. Authors
                            can also appeal against editorial decision, providing their own arguments and
                            explanations.<br>In case of manuscript acceptance, the publication process starts. If
                            rejected, the manuscript is sent to the author(s).</p>

                                processes related to the review and publication of articles should be as clear and
                                transparent as possible.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The editorial board, journal staff, authors,

                                easy and during which various situations may arise (that is, when a person has competing
                                interests or loyalty caused by his obligations to several persons or

                                potentially conflicting interests of both parties. A conflict of interests can be based
                                on financial relations (such direct conflicts of interest are usually easy to identify),
                                ideological, religious, and intellectual differences, academic gain, competition and

                                which excludes the possible data manipulation. The authors are fully responsible for

                                refuse to review the manuscript. If there is a potential conflict of interest, the
                                reviewer should report this to a Managing Editor or a Handling Editor and consult with
